This repository serves as the central hub for all open science activities at the Interdisciplinary Center for Archaeology and the Evolution of Human Behaviour (ICArEHB). Our researchers are acutely aware of the ethical, professional, and scientific implications of being stewards of the past. As part of this effort, we embrace the concept of Open Science where research is made transparent and reproducible at every step. 

## About ICArEHB

The Interdisciplinary Center for Archaeology and the Evolution of Human Behaviour (ICArEHB) is one of the premiere centers for archaeological science in Europe. Our vision is to inspire diverse audiences to engage with their heritage, contribute to the preservation of cultural diversity, and provide meaningful insights into current and future debates on human nature, behavior, and culture.

## How to contribute?
For a more extensive explanation on how to contribute, please see [How to contribute](https://github.com/eur-synclab/eur-synclab.github.io/blob/master/docs/welcome/contribute.md)

1. `fork` this repository to your own Github account by clicking the button on the upper right of this screen
2. Create a new branch in your forked repository which you will use to make changes in (your master branch will remain "clean" this way)
3. `clone` your forked repository to your local PC. If you do not how to do this, check out the Github section of the wiki!
4. Follow the installation steps for mkdocs [here](https://www.mkdocs.org/#installation)
5. On your local PC, navigate to your newly made branch and make changes in the relevant files
6. Write a `commit` message for every change you made
7. In your prompt, navigate to your repository directory with `cd C:/users/username/your/repo/directory` and run `mkdocs build` (if you want to preview the website locally, run `mkdocs serve` and in your browser, go to the http that is displayed, http://127.0.0.1:8000/)
8. If everything goes correctly, you can also open the new .html files in the `eur-synclab.github.io/site` folder to see what your changes will look like online
9. Push the changes to your remote (i.e., the repository on your Github account)
10. Make a pull request to merge your branch with the `eur-synclab/eur-synclab.github.io master` branch
11. Those who can directly edit this repository will then review your pull request and merge it with the `master` branch
12. Those who can directly edit this repository then have to locally navigate to `eur-synclab.github.io master` and then run `mkdocs gh-deploy`. This pushes the html pages to the `gh-pages` branch of this repository
13. Your changes are now visible on the [website](eur-synclab.github.io)!
