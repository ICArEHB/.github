This repository serves as the central hub for all open science activities at the Interdisciplinary Center for Archaeology and the Evolution of Human Behaviour (ICArEHB). Our researchers are acutely aware of the ethical, professional, and scientific implications of being stewards of the past. As part of this effort, we embrace the concept of Open Science where research is made transparent and reproducible at every step. 

## About ICArEHB

The Interdisciplinary Center for Archaeology and the Evolution of Human Behaviour (ICArEHB) is one of the premiere centers for archaeological science in Europe. Our vision is to inspire diverse audiences to engage with their heritage, contribute to the preservation of cultural diversity, and provide meaningful insights into current and future debates on human nature, behavior, and culture.
